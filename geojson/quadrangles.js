Around the cap there is a belt of sand dunes, which is possibly the largest dune field in our Solar System. Chasma Boreale is a valley close to the pole that could have been formed by melting of the ice from the North polar cap. Prominent craters of the region are Lomonosov and Korolev, which are unique in the northern region because there is not much change in topography."
